# batch_hard_link

Project is still in early development. I am using this project to learn Rust. Current functionality is limited to hard linking a single folder's contents to a destination folder.
To use, simply select the target folder using the pop up window, then select the destination folder.
Github rust analyser says failure, but that is becuase it cannot choose a folder.
